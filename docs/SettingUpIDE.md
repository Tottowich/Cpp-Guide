## Recommended Extensions 💡

To make your C++ journey smoother, we recommend the following VS Code extensions:

1. **C/C++**: For IntelliSense, debugging, and code browsing.
2. **Code Runner**: To quickly run code snippets for multiple languages, including C++.
3. **GitLens**: To supercharge the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code.
4. **Live Share**: To collaborate with others in real time.

To install these, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window and search for the extensions by name.
