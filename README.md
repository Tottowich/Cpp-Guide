## Getting Started 🛠

### Fork and Clone the Repository 🍴
Start your C++ journey by setting up your environment and trying out your first program!
Start by forking this repository and cloning it to your local machine. This can be done by following the steps below:

1. **Fork this repository** by clicking the Fork button in the top right corner of this page.
2. **Clone the forked repository** to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Cpp-Guide.git
    ```

3. **Navigate into the Repository**: Use the command below to enter the project directory.
